we can start with the Dependency map: essentially, what we could do is introduce a deletion at every position in the sequence and then observe how the predicted probabilities change across all remaining positions. This results in a scan-off map where each row corresponds to a deleted nucleotide position, and each column represents how that deletion influences the probability distribution at another genomic position. In practice, this can be visualized as a heatmap, with all possible deletions along the rows and their effects along the columns, allowing us to identify structured dependency patterns? and understand what is going on with the model overall.
